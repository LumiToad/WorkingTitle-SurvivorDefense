  <h1>WorkingTitle-SurvivorDefense</h1>

  <p>
    This game was developed as a student project in 10 weeks at the <a href="https://www.school4games.net">School For Games</a> in Berlin! <br />
    <b>IMPORTANT!</b> This repo represents an earlier stage of developement of the game <a href="https://suchti0352.itch.io/scrap-fever">Scrap Fever</a> (<a href="https://github.com/BasKrueger/ScrapFever/tree/main">Repo</a>)<br />
    I left the developement of the game, but only because another team lost their UI programmer.<br />
    Meanwhile <b>this</b> project was about to change it's scope to something much smaller for unrelated reasons.<br />
    A lot of unfinished features are still in this version of the game.

  <hr />
  <h2>Responsiblities</h2>
  - The entire gameplay programming -<br /><br />
  Including UI, Features, everything.<br />
  Since I started learning programming only a few month prior, I had some help from teachers.<br />
  But the implementation was still my responsibility.<br /><br />
  - Create tools, using Godot features -<br /><br />
  Created tools for level / game design, such as:<br />
    <li>Camera Control Zones</li>
    <li>Audio Control Zones</li>
    <li>Tutorial Control Zones</li>
    <li>Dialog Boxes</li>
    <li>Player Movement</li>
    <li>Level exit / Checkpoint control</li>
    <li>Enemy hp, speed, range, etc.</li>
    <br />
  - Communication with artists and game designers -<br /><br />
  As a small Team of seven people, everyone was involved with Game design.<br />
  Some initial ideas, the chains and some level design guidelines,<br />
  as well as the documentation of these concepts were part of my work.<br />
  Game design however was not my main responsibility.<br /><br />
  Explaining tools, communicate about file formats, implementation of assets and solving other problems was daily business.<br /><br />
  - Administrative work -<br /><br />
  Managing version control (back then - Mercurial using TortoiseHG), maintaining website and itch,<br />
  Google Drive and other software related things, prepared the build for presentations.<br />
  Besides managing (and learning) version control, this wasn't much workload though, as my team did a good job.
